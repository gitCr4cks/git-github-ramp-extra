1. The writing of this is co-credited to Johanna Bennett, Alex Turner's ex-girlfriend. The song's roots lie in a Mediterranean holiday Turner and Bennett took during which they were reminiscing about characters they knew at school. He recalls in The Times magazine July 28, 2007: "It started off as a joke. Then it were like, 'Here's another verse." We were having a laugh. Some of the lines were hers. I couldn't have not credited her. It's just right, really." 

2. The song's music video was directed by comedian Richard Ayoade, who is best known for playing the computer geek Maurice Moss in the UK Channel 4 sitcom The IT Crowd. Ayoade also helmed the band's Live At The Apollo DVD.
